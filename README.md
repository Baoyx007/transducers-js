# transducers-js

A high performance Transducers implementation for JavaScript.

## Releases and Dependency Information

* Latest release: 0.4.78

### JavaScript

You can include either the [release](http://cdn.cognitect.com/transducers/transducers-0.4.78-min.js)(8.9K gzipped) or [development](http://cdn.cognitect.com/transducers/transducers-0.4.78.js) build of transducers-js on your webpage. We also provide [Require.js](http://requirejs.org) compatible [release](http://cdn.cognitect.com/transducers/transducers-0.4.78-amd-min.js) and [dev](http://cdn.cognitect.com/transducers/transducers-0.4.78-amd.js) builds.

### Node.js

transducers-js is released to [npm](https://www.npmjs.org). Add transducers-js to your `package.json` dependencies:

```javascript
{...
  "dependencies": {
    "transducers-js": "0.4.78"
  }
 ...}
```

### Bower

You can also include transducers-js in your `bower.json` dependencies:

```javascript
{...
  "dependencies": {
    "transducers-js": "0.4.78"
  }
 ...}
```

## Usage

### Requiring

To import the library under Node.js you can just use `require`:

```js
var t = require("transducers-js");
```

The browser release of the library simply exports a top level
`transducers` object:

```js
var t = transducers;
```

### Basic Usage

With <=ES5:

```js
var map    = t.map,
    filter = t.filter,
    comp   = t.comp,
    into   = t.into;

var inc = function(n) { return n + 1; };
var isEven = function(n) { return n % 2 == 0; };
var xf = comp(map(inc), filter(isEven));

console.log(into([], xf, [0,1,2,3,4]));
```

With ES6:

```js
let {map, filter, comp, into} = t;

let inc = (n) => n + 1;
let isEven = (n) => n % 2 == 0;
let xf = comp(map(inc), filter(isEven));

console.log(into([], xf, [0,1,2,3,4]));
```
